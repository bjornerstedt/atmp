## Overview

Welcome to the ATMP app, for interactive analysis of payment plans for
ATMP treatments. For an introduction to the health models read [the
documentation]() and check the interactive [presentation of the example
models](model_analysis.Rmd).

At the top of the screen there are five tabs:

1.  *Overview* - The current tab
2.  *Model* - Select health model
3.  *Input* - See/modify the input values of the model
4.  *Analysis* - Analysis of the health model
5.  *Report* - Download a report of the analysis

The starting point of the analysis is a *health model*; tables of input
values specified in an Excel sheet. Selecting the *Model* tab displays a
page where you select the health model to analyse.

Once loaded, values can be modified under the *Input* tab, with results
displayed in the *Analysis* tab.
